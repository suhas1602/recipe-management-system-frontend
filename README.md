This is the frontend of my Recipe Management API repository. This is a SPA made with React.js.

## Development

Create a .env folder with the following value REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=<value>, where value is the endpoint where the backend is hosted. Then run `npm start`. The app will run on port 3001 by default. You can change the value in the scripts section of package.json.

## Build

Running `npm run build` will create a build folder with a production build of the app. I am running the app on an Apache HTTP server. For more details on how to deploy see https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/
